OORS - part of the RSIntheCloud project
==================

ResourceSpace V2 dev repo - Object Oriented ResourceSpace OORS

Change of emphasis

You may have noticed that my friends at sportarchive.tv are taking a rest from 
active development at the moment, which gives me a chance to catch up.

Over the last few months, I have been looking at how to short-cut development to 
get RSitC working for SportArchive, which has led to some out of order development
and rush jobs.

I have now stepped back, and this push will commit some phpUnit tests and the 
start of the new framework!
