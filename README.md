ResourceSpace V2 dev repo - Object Oriented ResourceSpace OORS

Testing / dev environment.  You are welcome to pull this, but don't expect it to work!

An integral part of porting ResourceSpace into the AWS cloud is to rewrite it as a modular,
class based system - Object Oriented ResourceSpace.  This repo contains a work in progress
to create a single server OO system which can then be migrated into the cloud.
